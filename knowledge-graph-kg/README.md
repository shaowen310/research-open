### Pipeline

#### Overview \[[Reference](https://towardsdatascience.com/conceptualizing-the-knowledge-graph-construction-pipeline-33edb25ab831)\]

1. Identifying entities and relationships from free text. Named entity resolution \(NER\).
2. Ontology extraction and formulate knowledge triplets. A \(domain\) ontology is a category for a domain of facts. 
3. Organizing facts \(or triplets\) in a knowledge graph.
