## Definitions

### Ontology

It often refers to "domain ontology", and represents concepts belong to a realm of the world. &#x20;

Each domain ontology typically models domain-specific definitions of terms. For example, the word card has many different meanings. An ontology about the domain of poker would model the "playing card" meaning of the word, while an ontology about the domain of computer hardware would model the "punched card" and "video card" meanings. \[From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology\_\(information\_science\))]

The identification of ontology is one of the jobs in NLP research.
