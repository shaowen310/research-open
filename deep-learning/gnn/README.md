# GNN

## Motivation

Many data are presented in the form of graphs. E.g,

* 3D meshes
* Social networks
* Telecommunication networks
* Biological networks
* Brain connections

We wish to extend neural networks to deal with arbitrarily structured graphs.

## Models

1. Graph Convolution Network (GCN)&#x20;
2. Graph Attention Networks (GAT) ICLR18 [Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10903.pdf)
