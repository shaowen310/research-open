# Adversarial Machine Learning

## Attack types

### Poisoning attack

\#training

This attack takes place during the training phase. The adversary tries to poison the training data to compromise the trained model.

### Evasion attack

\#testing

This attack takes place during the testing phase. The adversary tries to evade the system by adjusting testing samples.

### Exploratory attack

This adversary tries to gain knowledge about the learning algorithm of the underlying system and pattern in training data.
