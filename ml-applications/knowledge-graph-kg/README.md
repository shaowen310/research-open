# Knowledge Graph \(KG\)

## What is KG?

#### Brief definition

A collection of records in \(head\_entity_,_ relationship, tail_\__entity\) or \(entity_,_ attribute, literal\) format.

Entities usually represent real-world objects such as people, places or things.

Relationship encodes the relationship between entities.

Literal are constants.

## Why KG?

### Structural point of view

Structured data representation

#### Benefits

1. Categorized knowledge is easier for human to understand.
2. Derivation of complex concepts by combining primitive concepts.

### Application point of view

1. Initially for knowledge query. Knowledge enhanced search, such as searching products by description.
2. Identification of the missing links between entities, aka Knowledge Graph Completion \(KGC\) problem.

## How to build KG?

### Pipeline

#### Overview \[[Reference](https://towardsdatascience.com/conceptualizing-the-knowledge-graph-construction-pipeline-33edb25ab831)\]

1. Identifying entities and relationships from free text. Named entity resolution \(NER\).
2. Ontology extraction and formulate knowledge triplets. A \(domain\) ontology is a category for a domain of facts. 
3. Organizing facts \(or triplets\) in a knowledge graph.
