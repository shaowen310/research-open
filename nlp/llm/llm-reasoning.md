TLDR: Chain of thought unlocked LLMâ€™s reasoning capability.

The authors showed that reasoning abilities emerge in sufficiently large language models via chain-of-thought prompting.

The authors explore the ability of language models to perform few-shot prompting for **reasoning tasks.** **They supplied prompts that consist of triples**: \<input, chain of thought, output>.

They show that sufficiently large language models can generate chains of thought **if demonstrations of chain-of-thought reasoning are provided in the exemplars for few-shot prompting**.

The empirical evaluation shows the chain of thought prompting outperforms standard prompting on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks.

## Tree of thoughts. 2023/12/03. Google Brain.

TLDR: Tree of Thoughts enables exploration over coherent units of text (thoughts) that serve as intermediate steps toward problem-solving.

Motivation:

People search through a combinatorial problem space - a tree where the nodes represent partial solutions, and the branches correspond to operators that modify them. Which branch to take is determined by heuristics that help to navigate the problem-space and guide the problem-solver towards a solution.

Abstraction:

State: a partial solution with the input and the sequence of thoughts so far.

Value: evaluates the progress they make towards solving the problem. A heuristic for the search algorithm to determine which states to keep exploring and in which order.

Action: choosing a state to explore next.
